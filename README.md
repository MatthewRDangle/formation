## What is formation?
A ultra fast and light javascript constructor object for building and validating HTML forms.

## Installation
Currently formation is only offered as a self hosted js file. Download the file and add it to your project, then reference it with an inline script tag.

<pre>
<script src="[path to file]/formation.js"></script>
</pre>

## Versioning
Formation will be maintained under these versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<path>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:
+ Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch).
+ New additions to functionality without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch).
+ Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.
