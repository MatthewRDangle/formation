## What is formation?
A ultra fast and simple javascript constructor object for building and validating HTML forms. The constructor provides important form input validation straight out of the box allows for full UI customization. Review the demos inside the "demo" folder for more detail after you download.

Formation was build to support all modern browsers, from IE 11 onward, Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge. Designed for vanilla javascript. No polyfills required. :fire:

## Installation
Currently formation is only offered as a self hosted js file. Download the file and add it to your project, then reference it with an inline script tag.

<pre>
<script src="[path to file]/formation.js"></script>
</pre>

## Documentation
The only documentation available for formation is the inline comments served inside the project. Every line and function is well documented for crisp and clear instructions. If you need more assistance, the demos provide a better understanding of the use case for each set of functions.

At some point, this information will be available in the repository's wiki. Just not at this time.

## Getting Help
If you have any issue using formation, or would like to provide feedback, post an issue on github.

## Versioning
Formation will be maintained under these versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<path>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:
+ Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch).
+ New additions to functionality without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch).
+ Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.
